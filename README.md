Attached files were directly imported from project's directory.
IDE: Visual Studio 2019.

Basic focus was to use OOP concepts where:
1. "minesweeper.h" has 2d "cell.h" board (composition).
2. "minesweeper.h" itself was inherited from "game.h" which is an interface.
3. "main.h" creates object(s) and does dynamic casting to properly run the game.
4. "screenshots" directory contains all visuals of game.

All instructions on "how to play" are included inside the game, enjoy :)
